# Vexel-Assistant
Build 1 is out now! https://github.com/ItsMCB/Vexel-Assistant/releases/tag/v1

# What's Vexel Assistant?
It's a small script I made to help streamline certain things. I am by no means a pro when it comes to bash, but I was still able to make a basic script. Please remember this is mainly designed for my personal use, but you can download and use it too!

Vexel Assistant can currently:
- Help you install, uninstall, and use YouTube DL (ex. auto download the highest quality video, no need to type the custom args)
- Alert you about your internet connection status
- "Like Home" install. Automatically download apps you'll likely want.
- Check for the latest build (under version)


# What's your inspiration for making this?
My friend Nick introduced me to the Danganronpa video game francise. An AI called "Alter Ego" appeared in the game. I was hoping to download the app, but it was taken off the play store and app store. Yes... this was originally going to be a chat bot. While I've abandoned the idea for now, I might add it in later. For now, it's mainly function over form.

SUGGESTIONS / PULL REQUESTS?:
Feel free to suggest ideas, download my code, and make changes. Please make a pull request if you add something useful. I'd like to see this script turn into something super useful for everyone. ❤️ 

DISCLAIMER:
I am not liable for any issues relating to this code. Download and use it at your own risk!

NOTE:
You should never run a random script you find on the internet. While I hope you trust me, I advise you to look through my code. It's a good habit to get into if you download random stuff like this a lot.
